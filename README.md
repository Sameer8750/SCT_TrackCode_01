## Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders inÂ aÂ population. ðŸ“ˆ

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview:

The World Population dataset includes detailed information about countries and territories worldwide, including their population statistics, area, density, and growth rates.

**Key Features of the Dataset:**
- Rank: Rank of the country/territory based on population.
- CCA3: Country code (3 letters).
- Country/Territory: Name of the country or territory.
- Capital: Capital city.
- Continent: Continent where the country is located.
- 2022 Population: Population in 2022.
- 2020 Population: Population in 2020.
- 2015 Population: Population in 2015.
- 2010 Population: Population in 2010.
- 2000 Population: Population in 2000.
- 1990 Population: Population in 1990.
- 1980 Population: Population in 1980.
- 1970 Population: Population in 1970.
- Area (kmÂ²): Area in square kilometers.
- Density (per kmÂ²): Population density per square kilometer.
- Growth Rate: Population growth rate.
- World Population Percentage: Percentage of the world population.

## ðŸ§ª Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**EDA was conducted to uncover patterns and insights within the dataset:**

- Population Trends: Analyzed population trends over the decades.
- Continent Distribution: Examined the distribution of population across different continents.
- Density Analysis: Investigated population density and its variation among countries.
- Growth Rate Analysis: Studied the population growth rates across different countries and continents.
- Area Impact: Analyzed how the area of a country correlates with its population density.
- World Population Share: Explored the share of world population for each country.

## ðŸš€ Key Features
